## Abstract
Previous High Rate Sedimentation (HRS) teams have observed that the floc blanket is denser at the top than at the bottom of the recirculator at higher upflow velocities. This inconsistency in the floc blanket led former subteams to take multiple calculated approaches in attempts to improve floc blanket longevity and increase overall reactor performance. The Spring 2019 team has worked to replace old tubing and clean the laboratory sedimentation tank. The team is also in the process of designing and incorporating plate settlers within the sedimentation tank to determine whether doing so will improve floc blanket longevity. In the future, the team will explore the effects of varied plate orientation at various upflow velocities.

## Introduction
Sedimentation is the process by which coagulated contaminant particles are removed from water via gravitational settling. In a sedimentation tank, water flows upward as flocs settle downward. Those flocs settle into a "floc blanket" at the bottom of the sedimentation tank. A floc blanket is a fluidized bed of suspended solids with a high rate of collisions. The particles in the floc blanket collide with coagulant particles and other flocs, coming together to form heavier flocs that settle to the basin of the recirculator. These heavier flocs remain in the reactor as part of the floc blanket. This process cleans the water, resulting in a lower effluent NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Unit, a measure of clarity).

In the AguaClara lab sedimentation tank setup, a section of PVC piping known as the "tube settlers" simulates a life-size sedimentation tank's plate settlers. Multiple other tubing systems model the floc hopper and floc weir, as well as the inlet jet tube and influent and effluent lines that carry water in and out of the system. Since the behavior of a section of fluid is representative of the entire tank, tubing can be used to simulate a simple pathway in the reactor. This allows for a practical method of experimentation on a smaller scale. Refer to Figure 1 for a cross-sectional view of the sedimentation tank in an AguaClara plant to the sedimentation tank, and to Figure 2 for a visual representation of the model used by the HRS: Plate Settlers team.

Downward direction of the influent flow is redirected upward by the semicircular jet reverser bottom geometry. Small percentage of the flow is insufficient to supply an additional tube settler and was sent to waste (Garland (2017)).

The HRS team aims to design a tank that will yield an effluent of no more than 0.3 NTU while maintaining high upflow velocity. Operating at a higher upflow velocity will allow for a greater volume of water processing in a given period of time, which will decrease plant operating costs. However, when operating at a high upflow velocity in lab, the floc blanket is unstable. The floc blanket is dense near the top of the recirculator, but very thin near the bottom. HRS: Plate Settlers plans to remediate this issue by incorporating a second set of plate settlers within the sedimentation tank itself. As more particles enter through the manifold, flocs at the top of the blanket overflow into the floc hopper or floc weir. The smallest particles which make it past the floc blanket and floc hopper then enter the plate settlers. Plate settlers catch the smallest particles by increasing the horizontal space where particles can settle out. Plate settler length and width determines capture velocity, the lowest velocity at which plates can catch particles. By increasing the number of plate settlers, and thereby the area in which the flocs can settle, HRS: Plate Settlers intends to increase the capture velocity and therefore achieve a more stabilized floc blanket. If successful, this will allow future teams to continue researching the potential viability of high upflow velocities in AguaClara plants. Furthermore, progress in the context of plate settlers holds significance in a major improvement for High Rate Sedimentation as a subteam and for the process of flocculation in the overall surface water treatment process. Such advances would achieve a long-term goal of improving floc blanket stability (and thus improve the entire particle removal process) at both a model and real-life scale.

##Methods
HRS: Plate Settlers has approached the plan of incorporating plate settlers by developing a CAD (Computer-aided design) model of the plate settlers apparatus. The tentative design (Figure 3, Figure 4) included modifiable slots to test variable angles of plate entry, and a tapered edge to ensure plate settlers are locked in place during experiments. This way, plate settlers cannot fall into the sedimentation tank and will not vary in angle or orientation during testing. The model is hollow besides the plate settlers themselves, thus allowing water and flocs to flow freely through the apparatus as flocs hopefully settle on the plates.
The plates used in the CAD model are PVC plates were around 10 cm in length and 1 cm spacing. Thicknesses of the plates are varied 0.5-1 cm in separate trials. Plates were oriented initially 45 degrees, and then at 30 and 60 degrees in subsequent experiments to determine the effect of angle of entry on floc blanket stability.

## Future Work
(At this point in time, 'Future Work' will consist of our plans for the rest of the semester).
HRS: Plate Settlers' next steps include performing baseline tests with the plate settlers apparatus, which will be 3D-printed. PVC plates will inserted into the slots at a 45 degree angle initially. Following observation of these results, HRS: PS will perform subsequent experiments to determine how the effluent turbidity varies with changes in angle of the plates orientation, as well as with the alteration of variables such as number of plates, spacing of plates, and thicknesses of plates.


## Literature Review and Previous Work
Several past researchers have studied the process of sedimentation and the properties floc blankets. Their research gives valuable insight to the Fall Spring 2019 High Rate Sedimentation AguaClara team.

Culp et al. (1968) researched different angles to find the optimal slope of the tube settlers. Using normal laboratory conditions, a 60 degree angle with respect to the horizontal provided continuous sludge removal while showing effective sedimentation performance. This gives the team a starting condition that can be held constant and assumed as beneficial for plate settler designs.

Furthermore, Hurst (2010) noted that the presence of the floc blanket enhanced the removal of particles. Their experiments found that upflow velocities of 1.0 to 1.3 mm/s produced the best performance. Past HRS teams have been successful at establishing floc blankets at higher velocities than the range given by Hurst, up to 15 mm/s, but those floc blankets were not stable; therefore, in order to ensure stability the team will use the velocities aforementioned by Hurst.

In regards to controlling a blanket well, Swetland (2014) discovered that as larger flocs formed in the sedimentation tank, those flocs would settle due to their high density relative to the fluid. Additionally, they found that in order for particle removal to occur, flocs need to have a higher settling velocity than the capture velocity. As the flocs concentrate and fall to the bottom of the sedimentation tank, a floc blanket forms. These findings informed the High Rate Sedimentation teams' understanding of floc formation, so they can design a plate geometry that accommodates this settling and formation.

In a similar vein, Balwan (2016) explored how the length of the tube settlers affected effluent turbidity. He found that increasing the length of tube settler increased the amount of particles removed by the reactor. With tube settlers at an angle of 45 degrees and 60 cm length, turbidity removal was measured to be 80 percent. However, his experiments only had three length variables (40cm, 50cm, 60cm) and the effluent of longer tube settlers were unknown. As a result, the initial design for the plate settlers will have plastic at a 45 degree angle; however, this value could change based on testing.

Hurst (2016) derived that rather than just increasing the upflow velocity to increase the creation of the floc blankets, alum dosage must also be considered. The turbidity and upflow velocity work in tandem to determine the stability of a suspended floc blanket. In the experiments described in Hurst (2016), upflow velocity was held constant at 1.2 mm/s, but coagulant doses (ranging from 1.0 to 7.5 mg/L) were varied in 10 nephelometric turbidity units between 100 NTU and 500 NTU. That being said, 15 mg/L of alum was found to be a suboptimal dose, as the blankets would break in higher conditions. Hurst concluded that by increasing the ratio of influent turbidity to the dose, one could use a lower dose while still having the same rate of particle removal. The 2019 Spring HRS Plate Settlers team has considered the velocity and dose together. Hurst recommends a range of 1.0 to 7.5 mg/L of alum, so the team will use those values in a predictive model of the plate settlers.

In contrast to studying dose, Garland (2017) observed how the characteristics of flocs that enter a sedimentation tank influence the performance of the tank. In Garland’s experiment, G, the velocity gradient of the water in the tank, was increased in a range of 74–251  $s^-1$ while residence time in the water, θ, was decreased. This is because they influence each other. They concluded that a constant Gθ of ~20,000 improved the particle removal. Because of this, a residence time of 24 s with a G of 251  $s^-1$ resulted in 14 NTU; however, after varying G to 72 $s^-1$, the minimum turbidity was found to be 0.15 NTU. Garland concluded that velocity gradients greater than the existing specifications could be applied to reduce the flocculation time. As a result, the effects of the velocity gradients upon the plates will be heavily considered in the team’s designs.

The Summer 2018 Team observed that at higher upflow velocities, the floc blanket was much more dense at the top of the recirculator than at the bottom. They proposed that the Fall 2018 team design a recycle line to allow for flocs at the top of the recirculator to flow back to the bottom and re-establish a more uniform distribution. The Fall 2018 Team responded to this observation via incorporation of a recycle line along the recirculator to improve floc blanket longevity. The installation of a recycle line resulted in decreased reactor performance, as the effluent turbidity resulted in a consistent ~30 NTU increase versus the baseline trial throughout the test. Furthermore, water tended to flow up both the recirculator and recycle line rather than down the recycle line.

Following this research, the Fall 2018 team decided that future work might involve incorporating a peristaltic pump along the recycle line to ensure proper direction of water flow, which would help them prove their initial hypotheses. Currently, Flow Recycle has been placed on standby as HRS: Plate Settlers develops plates to incorporate into the sedimentation tank. This is a similar goal as Flow Recycle’s; thus, HRS: Plate Settlers is an extension of Flow Recycle. All things considered, it is imperative that the subteam considers density of the blanket as a function of the plate geometry, for that will contribute to both flow recycle and plate settler research.
